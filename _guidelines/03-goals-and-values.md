      Sunlight's "Whereas, Open Data" Roundup
---

<p>An open data policy can be pursued with the intent of realizing many different varieties of public good, including greater government transparency, honesty, accountability, efficiency, civic engagement and economic growth. An explicit statement of goals, values, or intention of an open data policy can help clarify the outcomes governments hope to achieve. A statement of mission highlights both the general importance of open data, and the specific importance of releasing information for that governmentâ€™s particular political context. In addition, the process of developing this statement may serve the democratic goal of increasing public participation by bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to explore the value of open data from their own perspectives.</p>
