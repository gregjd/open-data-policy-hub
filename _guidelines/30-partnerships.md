<p>Partnerships can be useful in a variety of important efforts related to data release, such as: increasing the availability of open data, identifying constituent priorities for data release (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#prioritization">Provision 5</a>), and connecting government information to that held by nonprofits, think tanks, academic institutions and nearby governments. Such partnerships can <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/poi/power-of-information-review.pdf">aid civic participation</a> and help identify gaps in service delivery, among other benefits. Public-private partnerships can be via contract, informal cooperation, or an exchange for rights or privileges. In addition to using commonly used formats, reaching out to nearby governments to explore ways to share data, experience, and workloads can assist in achieving open data outcomes.</p>
