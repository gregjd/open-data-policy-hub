<p>In addition to releasing information in formats that allow for the maximal amount of technical reuse, appropriate methods of distribution should be considered in order to maximize the degree of access, use, and quality of published information. For example, if a government report is most effectively distributed via a PDF format, but contains data elements that would be most digestible via a structured format, both the report and accompanying structured dataset should be released with relative referential metadata (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#metadata">Provision 13</a>). Similarly, options for bulk download should also recognize the strength of allowing for access to information in various formats. This degree of access and interaction allows citizens and government alike to get the most out of the data.</p>
