<p>Data quality will not be ensured through data release alone: efforts need to be made to keep the data up-to-date, accurate, and accessible. Data release should be approached as an iterative and ongoing process. As soon as sensitive information and security concerns are met, data should be released and regularly updated as it improves and grows. Data with serious accuracy and quality concerns should be adequately documented to avoid creating confusion or misinformation. Similarly, public data reporting streams separate from what's used within government should be avoided whenever possible, as redundant or parallel data streams create opportunities for data quality to falter. Each update should include clear and complete metadata (including a conspicuous contact person), group datasets where appropriate, and address concerns noted via a prominent feedback mechanism.</p>
