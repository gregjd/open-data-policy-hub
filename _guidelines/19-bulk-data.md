<p>Bulk access provides a simple but effective means of publishing data sets in full by enabling the public to download all of the information stored in a database at once. This is a step beyond simply making select data sets or search results available for download or export, and is critical for supporting the maximal reuse and analysis of data. Whether offered as a feature of a data portal—or even as a simple “click to download” button on a government agency webpage describing or displaying information—bulk access to information is often one of the simplest and most direct steps a government entity can take to share public information.</p>
