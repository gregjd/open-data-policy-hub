`index.html` has the Collection home page. (The map is generated by [this](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/blob/master/assets/js/open-data-map.js) JavaScript file.)

`by-date.md` and `alpha.md` have the lists of all policies by date and by name, respectively.

`states.md` powers a page that lets you view a list of policies for each state. It didn’t seem that useful, so it’s not promoted on the site — though you can still visit it if you really want to and happen to know about its existence thanks to this readme ;)

`analytics.html` powers a page that lists various summary statistics about the policies, like how many came from different types of governments, or how many received different types of assistance from Sunlight. Many of the fields on the page are generated using various [`/_includes`](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/tree/master/_includes) files. Although publicly accessible, this page has not been promoted and is a little unpolished.

So what about the actual policies? First, there’s one key difference to understand: _policies_ versus _places_. A _policy_ refers to an individual open data policy. A _place_ refers to a local or state government; a place can have multiple policies. Polices are in [`_policies`](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/tree/master/_policies) while places are in [`_places`](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/tree/master/_places). Each policy's `place` metadata field is used to match it with its respective place file. The display of each policy is governed by [this](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/blob/master/_layouts/policy.html) HTML template.
