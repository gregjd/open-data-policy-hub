<p>All numbers reported below are numbers of places/governments. In general, number of places is a better metric than number of policies, since a place may have multiple "policies" that are really meant to go together (like a Council Resolution then an Administrative Policy) or successive policies that build on one another.</p>

<h2>Key figures</h2>

<p>[Could put a summary sentence or two here, including a select number of the figures below.]</p>

<!-- Total -->

<!-- Explaining how the above numbers fit together -->
<p>How the numbers add up:</p>
<p>{{ locals_old_uniq_places | size }} local before WWC + {{ locals_new_uniq_places | size }} local during WWC âˆ’ {{ locals_both_place_ids | size }} overlap = {{ locals | size }} total local</p>
<p>{{ locals | size }} local + {{ states | size }} state {% if num_unknowns > 0 %}+ {{ num_unknowns }} unknown {% endif %}= {{ site.places | size }} grand total</p>

<p>Now let's look at three categories of places: What Works Cities, non-WWC local governments, and state governments. Note that the lists here only include those with policies. So, for example, the number next to "What Works Cities" represents the number of What Works Cities with policies, not the total number of What Works Cities.</p>
