`index.md` is the main Guidelines page.

The information for each Guideline is given in the files in the [/_guidelines](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/tree/master/_guidelines) folder.

The three guideline groups shown on the list of all guidelines are according to the three sections found [here](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/blob/master/_data/guideline-sections.yaml); each guideline’s file has a field called `section` that’s used to match to this file.

When you click on a guideline, the page that you see is generated using [this](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/blob/master/_layouts/guideline.html) HTML template. The list of sample guideline language is generated by the script in this file, which looks through the [policies](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/tree/master/_policies) on the site for text that has been tagged like so: `<span class="g-goals-and-values">collaborating with the public and across government</span>` (this example is for the [`goals-and-values`](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/open-data-policy-hub/blob/master/_guidelines/03-goals-and-values.md) guideline). Text tagging is not perfect. It was based on attempting to match text (via a string-matching algorithm) to an old Google Sheet that had human-entered copied-and-pasted text from policies.
